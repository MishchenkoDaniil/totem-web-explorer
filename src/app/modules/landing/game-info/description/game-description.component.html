                inner demon!
                We’ve been through hell and back to get here. Playing together for 10 years despite our
                differences, I know we have what it takes.
                Dead Pets is a slice of life, management-lite, narrative game about music and friendship.
                Playing as Gordy, you’ll go to band practice, manage Gordy’s finances and wellbeing, as well
                find time to earn enough money to cover rent.
                From the creators of Welcome to Elk, dive into the demon world of New Void City, and give your
                childhood dreams one last chance. It’s time to dream big, grow up and rock out!

                Content Warning: Dead Pets Unleashed will contain a major storyline relating to sexual
                harassment. We are working with a consultant with this to ensure the storyline is handled in a
                sensitive way, and there will be tools implemented for the player to ensure their comfort and
                safety while playing.
