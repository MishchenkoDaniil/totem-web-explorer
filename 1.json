Acquire upgrades, use your wits, and battle powerful pixel art enemies. With one Dark Power at the top and another at the bottom, will you be powerful enough to ensure peace and prosperity for your people?\n\n- Be tactical: you don't have to rush to make your decisions, so make them wisely.\n- Go up or down: you may start your run going to the top of the Keep or into the depths of its dungeons.\n- Collect 15+ upgrades (with the list growing during development!) to make your character a fitting adversary to the Dark Powers."
